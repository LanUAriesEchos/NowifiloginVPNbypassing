# Stops X-VPN from being allowed to connect to its ips

Currently iun progress but my gosh darn Thinkpasd dont want to boot into barebones android

What is this?
its a ip/domain list so schools/organizations can prevent the use of theese vpns as they are a very huge security risk. I using X-VPN was able to see EVERYTHING on a network with a captive portal. Without even being logged into the captive portal. So I feel that businesses should know theese addresses and block them via firewall.
