What is this?
its a ip/domain list so schools/organizations can prevent the use of theese vpns as they are a very huge security risk. I using X-VPN was able to see EVERYTHING on a network with a captive portal. Without even being logged into the captive portal. So I feel that businesses should know theese addresses and block them via firewall.

# Keep in mind!!!!
Theese is evertyhing that came out of the DNS with everything closed exeept for wireshark and X-VPN on a windows pc I would go through this in a test enviroment and make sure it doesent break anything. I will filter it soon!
